/*
thinking:
    
    need to join the two tables (employee_id connects the tables)
    from here, need to gather rows that have either name or salary missing
        (the question is worded as "or", not sure if there are test cases where both name and salary are gone)
    
    clarification: "missing" does not mean that the ID exists in a table but the value is null, it means that the row (id and value) simple do not exist in the table
    need to exclude the inner join of the two tables
    
notes:

select employee_id from employees where employee_id not in (select employee_id from salaries)

select employee_id from salaries where employee_id not in (select employee_id from employees)
