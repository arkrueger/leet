    we will need:

    select product_id, "store1" as store, store1 as price from products

how it works:
    
    first line - select our desired final columns from the temporary table view we created below it
    from ( etc ) - 3 select statements that produce 3 views that differ by one column name
        -> store1, store2, store3
        id  store   price  | id  store   price  | id  store  price
        0   store1  xyz    | 0   store2  def    | 0   store3  qrs
        1   ""      abc    |     ""      tuv    |     ""      jgk
        and so forth...
        union all on these tables gives us a table with columns:
        id  store  price
                    price will be null if the store did not carry that item
                    store will contain "store1" "store2" or "store3"
    as temp allows us to reference it in the first line
    where temp.price is not null allows us to exclude rows
