# we have two tables, one for customers and one for orders
# we want to find all customers that don't order, i.e. all customers that don't have any entries in the order table
# -> select name from customers and exclude the common ids that appear in both tables

# three ways to do this
# select name as "Customers" from customers where not exists (select 1 from orders where orders.customerId = customers.id)

# select name as "Customers" from customers left join orders on orders.customerId = customers.id where orders.customerId is null;

# select name as "Customers" from customers where customers.id not in (select customerId from orders);
