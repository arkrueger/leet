# Please write a DELETE statement and DO NOT write a SELECT statement.
# Write your MySQL query statement below

# we can use the min() function to find the smallest value
# wait, no we can't

# better approach
delete p1 from person p1, person p2
where p1.email = p2.email and p1.id > p2.id

# how does this work?

# the first line selects all columns from the table as p1, while also giving us a secondary reference to compare to (p2)
# the second line associates duplicate emails (the = conditional) but only those that are greater than a peer (i.e. it will not select the lowest-id email row in a collection of duplicate emails, because it is not larger than any given p2.id where p1.email=p2.email)

# to recap, for each unique email, the where clause:
#   gets the rows with duplicate emails
#   excludes the email that is not larger than any one of its peers in this group (i.e. the lowest id row among these duplicate emails)
# then deletes all of these emails (leaving behind the lowest-id email row)
